# Commune code
https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_officiel_géographique#Code_commune

The “commune code” includes the coding of the department followed by the coding of the municipality, within the department10 (see list).

Coding of municipalities: the numbering was initially established in the alphabetical order of the names of municipalities. It was not modified when municipalities changed their name or were merged, the old codes remaining unused. When municipalities were created, they received a number following the existing list.
mainland municipalities: 3 digits (from 001);
overseas communes: 2 digits (from 01).
similar codes, from 75101 to 75120, are assigned to the twenty arrondissements of Paris (Paris as a commune has the code 75056)
Each French commune can thus be identified by a unique 5-digit code (the first two of which, for metropolitan communes, or the first three, for those overseas, identify the department).

Example: the code for the commune of Cholet is 4909911. It breaks down as follows:

49: code of the department of Maine-et-Loire (initially in alphabetical order);
099: code of the municipality in the department (initially in alphabetical order).
The three-digit code of the municipality is the one used in particular in the social security number in France.
